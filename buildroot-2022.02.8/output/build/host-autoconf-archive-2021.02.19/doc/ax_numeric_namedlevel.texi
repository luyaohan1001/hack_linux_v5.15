@majorheading Synopsis

@smallexample
AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(VARNAME [,FROMVAR [,DEFAULT [,YESLEVEL]]])
@end smallexample

@majorheading Description

The levelstring FROMVAR is expanded and checked for verbal names that
will map on to eight different levels - the VARNAME will receive this
numeric level where "all" maps to 7 (lower three bits set) higher levels
for 8 and 9 exist too. This macro is a nice helper to convert user input
of a --with-opt=level into a numeric form that can be simply pushed as a
#define like with AC_DEFINE:

@smallexample
 default YESLEVEL = 2 /* including unknown levelspec */
 default DEFAULT  = 0 /* when named level is empty */
 default FROMVAR  = VARNAME
@end smallexample

The DEFAULT value is used if the NAMED levelstring has become empty and
it is copied without further conversion - a default of "0" is used if
absent - identical to "no". A "yes" will be set to the YESLEVEL - and
note that "yes" has "2" as its default value not "1". (which comes from
its original use to set a "gcc -O2").

the mnemonic names are:

@smallexample
  9| insane |ultrasome|experimentalplus
  8| ultra  |ultra|experimental)
  7| all    |muchmore|somemanymore|manymoreplus
  6| most   |manymore|most)
  5| strict |somemore|almost
  4| more   |more
  3| extra  |manyplus|plusmuch|somemany|plusmany
  2| many   |many|much|(yes)
  1| some   |some|plus
@end smallexample

note that a level can be constructed of (some|plus) = bit-0, (many|much)
= bit-1, (more) = bit-2, (ultra|experimental) = bit-3 at least in a
left-to-right order, ie. plusmanymore=7

Example usage:

@smallexample
  AX_NUMERIC_NAMEDLEVEL(OPTLEVEL,with_optlevel,1,3)
  AC_DEFINE(OPTLEVEL)
  test "$GCC" = "yes" && CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -O$OPTLEVEL)
@end smallexample
